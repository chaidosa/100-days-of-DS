These libraries  are fundamental tools for data manupuation, analysis, and visualization in Python, and are widely used in the data science community. By following the steps outlines in this colad notebook, you can ensure that you have the necessary software and libraries installled to perform data science task effectively using Python. In the subsequent section/days of this notebook will dive deeper into these libraries and learn how to utilize then for various data science task.\n",
