## 100-days-of-Code- Data Science
Welcome to the 100 Days of Code challenge for data science! This is a comprehensive 100-day plan to learn and master various aspects of data science through coding and hands-on practice. Whether you are a beginner or have some experience in data science, this challenge will provide you with a structured roadmap to improve your skills and gain confidence in your data science abilities.

# How to Use This Repository
This repository serves as a guide and roadmap for the 100 Days of Code challenge for data science. Each day has a specific task or topic to learn and practice. You can follow the schedule provided and complete one task per day, or adjust the timeline to fit your own pace.

Inside each folder for each day, you will find a README.md file that contains a detailed description of the task or topic for the day, along with any relevant instructions, resources, and code snippets. You are encouraged to read through the README file carefully and follow the instructions to complete the task for the day.

Feel free to customize your learning experience by choosing your own datasets, coding environments, and tools. You can use any programming language, libraries, or frameworks that you are comfortable with or interested in learning.

# Prerequisites
To participate in the 100 Days of Code challenge for data science, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts, such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Familiarity with a programming language such as Python or R is recommended but not required. You should also have access to a computer with internet connectivity, a text editor, and a programming environment of your choice.
